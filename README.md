  - >"Require contributors to sign off on web-based commits" adds an additional layer of acknowledgment to commits made through the GitHub web interface. When contributors sign off on commits, they are essentially agreeing to certify that they have the right to submit the code and are licensing it under the project's open-source license.

- **Allow rebase merging**: `Off`
  - >"Allow rebase merging" is a feature in GitHub that allows users to merge pull requests using the "Rebase and merge" option. Rebase merging is a technique where the changes in the pull request are applied on top of the latest changes in the target branch, resulting in a cleaner and linear commit history.
  - >By disabling rebase merging, GitHub will only allow traditional merge commits when merging pull requests. This can help maintain a more straightforward history and avoid any unintended consequences associated with rebase operations.

- **Always suggest updating pull request branches**: `On`
  - >Enabling the "Always suggest updating pull request branches" setting in GitHub can be beneficial for keeping pull request branches up to date with changes in the base branch. When this setting is enabled, GitHub will automatically suggest updating the pull request branch when it becomes out of date with the base branch, typically due to new commits being added to the base branch.

- **Automatically delete head branches**: `Off`
  - >By enabling this setting, GitHub will automatically delete head branches after pull requests are successfully merged, helping to keep your repository clean and organized.
